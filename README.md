# POKIMON: An Ontological Model for Geological Modeling

POKIMON (Processes, Observation, Information, Knowledge, and Modeling ONtology) is an evolving ontology designed to support geological modeling by establishing semantic and structural relations between geological entities. This model enables users to represent, manage, and retrieve geological knowledge with enriched semantic detail, enhancing the effectiveness of geological data management and querying, principally for the 3D modeling field.

Note: This ontology is always under development, and this release represents a beta version. Future updates will include expanded concepts, relationships, and use cases as the model evolves to better capture complex geological knowledge.
## Contents

This repository includes:

    POKIMON Ontology File: The main ontology file (new_pok.owl) defining key concepts, relationships, and the model structure.
    Use Case Examples:
        examples_phd_manuscript: Demonstrates specific POKIMON examples used in the PhD manuscript.
        example_chapter_1: Contains a small, unrelated ontology used as a reference in the PhD manuscript (chapter_1).
        dev_example: Includes multiple examples used during the development and debugging of POKIMON.

## Requirements

To work with POKIMON, you will need:

    Ontology Editing Software: Protégé (recommended) or any other OWL-compatible ontology editor for opening and modifying the ontology.
    SPARQL Support: An editor with SPARQL query capabilities, such as Protégé, to execute provided queries and enable advanced information retrieval.

Getting Started

    download the zip file from the current github repo. Recent advances can be found in the branch (POKIMON_beta)
    Load the Ontology: Open the POKIMON ontology file (new_pok.owl) in Protégé or another compatible ontology editor.
    Explore Use Cases: Review the examples in the Use Case Examples folder to understand how geological concepts and relationships are represented within POKIMON.
    Run SPARQL Queries: Use the SPARQL queries provided to explore POKIMON’s querying capabilities and retrieve geological information based on semantic relationships.

For further details or troubleshooting, please refer to the project documentation or reach out to the Protégé user community.
